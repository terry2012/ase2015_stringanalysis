To improve mobile app security and privacy, various systems have been proposed.
For example, TaintDroid~\cite{TaintDroid} and VetDroid~\cite{VetDroid} apply
dynamic taint analysis to monitor apps and detect runtime privacy leakage in
Android apps. ScanDroid~\cite{ScanDroid} aims to automatically extract data flow
policy from the manifest of an app, and then check whether data flows in the
apps are consistent with the extracted specification. Alazab {\em et
al.}~\cite{Alazab:2012:AMB} provide a dynamic analysis technique that runs apps
in a sandbox and detects malicious apps. MockDroid~\cite{Beresford:2011:MTP} is
a tool that protects users' privacy by supplying mock data instead of sensitive
data. Aurasium~\cite{Xu:Security:2012} provides user-level sandboxing and policy
enforcement to dynamically monitor an app for security and privacy violations.
Notably, Aurasium does not require modifications to the underlying OS.
CrowDroid~\cite{Burguera:2011:CBM} is an offline analysis over traces that can
be leveraged to identify malicious apps through examining their behavior via
crowdsourcing. Moonsamy {\em et al.}~\cite{Moonsamy:2012:TUI} provided a
thorough investigation and classification of 123 apps using static and dynamic
techniques over the apps' Java source code. Our own work,
BlueSeal~\cite{Blueseal}, proposes a new permission mechanism by leveraging
static data flow analysis to discover sensitive data usage and improves Android
app security. PiOS~\cite{DBLP:conf/ndss/EgeleKKV11}, a static analysis tool for
iOS, leverages reachability analysis on control-flow graphs to detect leaks.
ComDroid~\cite{ComDroid} and Woodpecker~\cite{Woodpecker} expose the confused
deputy problem~\cite{Deputy} on Android.
