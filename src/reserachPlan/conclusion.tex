\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we presented a tool for disambiguating strings within Android
apps. Our tool performs a string analysis over an Android app,
creating a graph-based representation of the code blocks used in generating 
strings. An abstract interpretation of the graph yields a set of potential
constructed strings. Our results indicate that many strings can be fully
disambiguated (quantified) statically within Android apps. Reasoning
about the disambiguated strings gives additional insights into the structure and
purpose of an Android app.

As part of our future work, we plan to integrate our string analysis engine into
\bs~\cite{Blueseal}, a static data flow analysis tool we have built. Based on
our preliminary results, we believe that our string analysis engine will improve
the precision of \bs's flow analysis, specifically in identifying flows that are
likely present in malicious code and conversely identifying when suspicious
flows are in fact benign.
